# Proxy Configuration Fix

## Issue Fixed
The React frontend was trying to proxy requests to `localhost:5001`, but the backend is running on `localhost:8080`.

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `package.json`** - Changed proxy from `http://localhost:5001` to `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Updated `setup.bat`** - Corrected backend URL reference
3. **Created connection test** - `connection-test.js` to verify both services

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Restart React Server (Recommended)
1. Stop the current React server (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal)
2. Run `npm start` again in the frontend directory
3. The proxy will now correctly route to `localhost:8080`

### Option 2: Use the Restart Script
1. Run `restart-frontend.bat` in the frontend directory
2. This will automatically stop and restart the React server

### Option 3: Use VS Code Tasks
1. Terminate the current "Start React Frontend" task
2. Run the task again from the Command Palette

## Verification
After restarting, you should no longer see the proxy errors. The favicon requests will now be properly routed to the backend at `localhost:8080`.

## Test Connection
Run this command in the frontend directory:
```bash
node connection-test.js
```

This will verify both backend and frontend are running correctly.

## Configuration Summary
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:8080` ✅
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5002` ✅
- **Proxy Target**: `http://localhost:8080` ✅

## Next Steps
1. Restart the React server
2. Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:5002`
3. Test authentication flows
4. No more proxy errors should appear

*Issue resolved: Proxy configuration now matches backend port 8080*
